* cytoHubba: identifying hub objects and sub-networks from complex interactome <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25521941/>

We retrieved transcriptomic data from MPS with neurological impairment in GEO (GSE111906 of MPS I, GSE95224 MPS II, GSE23075 MPS IIIB, GSE15758 MPSIIIB, and GSE76283 of MPS VII). We constructed the networks using string database v.11, and the hub gene analysis was performed with Cytohubba v.0.1 in the Cytoscape v.3.8. We used all the local-based methods (MCC, DMNC, MNC, and Degree) and all the global-based methods (EPC, BottleNeck, EcCentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress), calculating the top 10 nodeâ€™s scores. We check the first-stage nodes and the expanded subnetwork.
